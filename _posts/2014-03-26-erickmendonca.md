## Who are you, and what do you do?

I am a convicted gamer. I have a lust for code. Besides coding, I really like to write other things. Fiction, mostly. I'm married with a great photographer and we have a little kid who loves [Plants vs Zombies](http://www.popcap.com/plants-vs-zombies-1) and throw things out of the window. My phone included.

Besides playing I love to make games. I loved to change RPG's rules as a [Dungeons & Dragons](http://www.wizards.com/dnd/) Dungeon Master and I still like to do it on [Unity](https://unity3d.com/pt) projects.

## What hardware do you use?

- A Windows laptop most of the time to write code.
- A Windows desktop as a home server, with Ubuntu installed as a second OS.
- A smartphone to browse, mail, message and play on the go.
- I play games mainly through Steam on Windows PCs.

The laptop is Core i7 LG machine with 6 GB of RAM and a 750 GB HDD. It packs a NVidia Geforce GT 555M video card, powerful enough to play some games, connected via HDMI to a TV, accompanied by a Xbox controller.

My desktop is an older machine, a Pentium Dual Core, 4 GB of RAM. It is really old, but just enough to be my server and entertain my boy with little games.

The smartphone is a Moto X. I'd have an iPhone 4 before that, and both iOS and Android are great mobile OSes.

## And what software?

In the last year I changed my workflow and used much more tools than I was accustomed. I was used to code a lot in C# on Visual Studio with SQL Server databases. Today I'm more eclectic: Python, Java, C# and Javascript are my day-to-day buddies.

I'm curious with Ruby and C++ and like to play with them a little. As databases, I've used MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite and Google Datastore too.

I like to use command-line tools, but don't feel so agile with them for day-to-day tasks. Except for Git and Python, which I often use shell tools, I use nice graphical tools :-)

I have much interest on game designing and development, and play with hardware on Arduino and Raspberry Pi. Got a Pi few months ago just to mess around. I'm also researching applications of Kinect as an alternate communication tool.

- [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com/3) is my main place to go for code. While working with C#, I use [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/) and [Monodevelop](http://monodevelop.com/).
- [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) is my preferred game engine.
- [Git](http://git-scm.com/) is my favorite version control tool. I use [GitHub](http://github.com/) and [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.com/) almost everyday.
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/pt/br/default.aspx) Management Studio to manipulate SQL Server databases, [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/) for PostgreSQL's databases.
- I'm using [SimpleNote](http://simple-note.appspot.com/) to take notes and control lists and tasks. Fast and simple. On some projects I use [Mavenlink](http://mavenlink.com) or [Asana](http://asana.com/).
- [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com/) is a simple tool to monitor my time spent coding.
- [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) is my gaming pal.
- [Chrome still is the best browser out there. Period.](http://b.erickmendonca.com.br/post/42979058814/my-setup-2013)
- I don't always listen to music while coding, but when I do [Deezer](http://deezer.com/) is good enough.

## What would be your dream setup?

My dream setup is a PC, not so much powerful than mine, but with two large and high-res screens, in a quiet, clean, sound and child-proof room. My laptop would be much more thinner and lighter, the screen would not be useless on sunlight and the batteries would last a full day at least. 

I'm not asking much, am I?

In fact, the PC doesn't matter so much. But I would really love a child-proof room!
