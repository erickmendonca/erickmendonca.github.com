## Who are you, and what do you do?

I am a person who loves coding stuff.

## What hardware do you use?

I use Macintosh to write codes.
I use 2 Linux computers as a server.
I play video games with Windows computer.
I use iPad to browse internet.

I don't use hardware anything special.

## And what software?

I love [Ruby]. I've started learning because there are great projects such as [Sinatra], [Compass], [nanoc]... which all written by Ruby. I don't know about Ruby on Rails. I like start coding with the smallest thing.

[Avahi]://avahi.org
[Compass]://compass-style.org
[Fish shell]://ridiculousfish.com/shell/
[GitHub Pages]://pages.github.com
[Git]://git-scm.com
[iTerm2]://code.google.com/p/iterm2/
[iTunes]://www.apple.com/itunes/
[LiveReload]://livereload.com
[nanoc]://nanoc.ws
[PuTTY]://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/
[Ruby]://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
[Sinatra]://www.sinatrarb.com
[SSH]://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell
[TextMate2]://github.com/textmate/textmate
[TextMate]://macromates.com
[Vim]://www.vim.org

I love using Shell.

- [Vim] is like a Swiss Army Knife at coder.
- [Fish shell] is usefull. But my experiences not enough.
- [SSH] and [Avahi] change my computing is easier.
- [Git] makes coding is fun. You know that this website built with [GitHub Pages].

Consol-based feels make me nerdly. But I like GUI things too.

- When I boot up my computer, [iTunes] wakes up too(Sometimes I purchase a song at Web).
- [TextMate] was my favorite editor. Nowadays [TextMate2] is my favorite.
- [LiveReload] is one of the greatest app coding. I hope pow makes Cross-platform.
- [iTerm2] and Open Source Pro is my favorite screen. [PuTTY] is good one.

And...my most favorite software was CSSEdit. I write [Compass] and [LiveReload] instead of CSS.

## What would be your dream setup?

[iTunes] is being suck. I don't want use them. Now I'm working on my dream setup with my coding. The shortest answer is *Do it myself*. But it is the longest way. Now I try to be an Open-source commiter. I plan to make best Music App.

Also I have interesting with hardware development. Yeah I don't have any knowridge with building from 0. I want to create with [Arduino](//www.arduino.cc), LED lights, and my dream setup is like a Dexter's Laboratory.
